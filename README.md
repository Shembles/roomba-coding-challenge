# Roomba Coding Challenge!

A cleaning Roomba simulation machine that searches for 18 random dirty tiles and clean them, on a 8 x 8 grid floor.

## Potential Fixes

- I logged the images on the tiles using css classes. So the roomba images glitches a bit when on a spot of a cleaned tile.
- Roomba still struggles a bit with going back to the point of origin. There is a lot of fixes and improvements needed.
